# This file needs to be called from your makefile when using libacfutil.
# It produces the necessary cflags and libs to include all the build-time
# and link-time dependencies of libacfutils.
#
# You should invoke this script in one of the following two ways:
#
# 1) to generate CFLAGS:
#	$ <path_to_libacfutils>/pkg-config-deps 'ARCH' --cflags
# 1) to generate LDFLAGS:
#	$ <path_to_libacfutils>/pkg-config-deps 'ARCH' --libs
#
# Where 'ARCH' is should be one of: 'win-64', 'win-32', 'linux-64',
# 'linux-32' 'mac-64' and 'mac-32' (depending on the target being built for).
